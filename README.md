## Hello Visualization Lovers ðŸ“Š...

I'm Ganesh Nagarvani and I love visuals and graphics. We can do visualizations in python or R with libraries like MatPlotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, etc.
But I prefer dedicated visualalization softwares and Tableau Desktop is my goto software for that.

Not only we can gain quick information through Tableau but also perform custom operations in it. That's the edge Tableau has over other softwares.

In this repo I've saved tableau's .twb and .twbx files

This files include:
- Use of different types of graphs like Bar, Treemaps, Scatter plots, Stacked, Pie, Gantt, Bubbles, etc.
- How to use Filters and customize them. 
- How to create Parameters, Calculated Fields, Heirarchy, Custom Groups.
- How to make Dashboards and present them.
- How to integrate R with Tableau Desktop.
- Data Blending and animations.
- How to use Analytics option and forecast on time series and other data. And much more...
